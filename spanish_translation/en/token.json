Governance token represents the power of governing the community or decision-making of the protocol (e.g. revising rules).

As an analogy of a hotel, a governance token lets the holder participate in the hotel management; whereas a privilege token is like the hotel's VIP card, giving the holder access to the hotel's advanced services.",
